Maven is an autnomation nd managenment tool developed by Apache Software Foundation it is based on Pom(Project based Model)

* Maven can build any number of projects into desired output such as .jar,.war
* Mostly used for Java based Projects
* maven is written in Java
* Meaning of Maven is "Accumulator of Knowledge"

Maven Uses:
* It makes Project easy to build.
* Easy to add new dependencies.
* The tool helps get the right jar file for each project as there may versions of separate packages

Dependencies:
It refer to libraries that are needed for project

Pom (Project Object Model)

Pom refers to the xml file that have all the information regarding project and configuration details

artifact:
Nothing but which containe final code

Local Repository:
Local repository refers to the machine of the developer where all the project material is saved

Remote Repository:
It refer to the repository presenton a webserver which is used when maven need to download dependencies This repository works same as the central repo wheneverv anything is needed from remote repository it is first downloaded to the local repo and then it is used

central repository:
Central repository refers to the maven community that comes into action when there is a need of dependencies and those dependencies cannot be found in the local repository

Maven Build Life-Cycle

* Generate resource
* compile code
* unit test
* package(Build)
* install (into local repo & artifactory)
* Deploy (to serves)
8 Clean (delete all run time files)

Artifact ID: It is an identifier for a specific piece of software or a project. 
In the context of Maven, the Artifact ID is part of a unique identifier that distinguishes different software components. The full unique identifier in Maven consists of three main components:

Group ID: This represents the group or organization that produces the project (e.g., org.apache.maven.plugins).
Artifact ID: This is the name of the project or the specific module (e.g., maven-compiler-plugin).
Version: This indicates the specific version of the project/module (e.g., 3.8.1).

Commands:
mvn compile "compile code"
mvn test "to test"
mvn Package " package"
mvn install "to install"

Plug in:
A plugin is a software add-on that is installed on a program, enhancing its capabilities. 
For example, if you wanted to watch a video on a website, you may need a plugin to do so. 
If the plugin is not installed, your browser will not understand how to play the video

Types of build tool

steps to install jdk:
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install -y java-11-openjdk-devel
java -version 

set path:
nano~/.bashrc

export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-11.0.11.0.9-1.amzn2.0.1.x86_64
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

source ~.bashrc 

Steps to install Maven:

wget https://downloads.apache.org/maven/maven-3/3.8.6/binaries/apache-maven-3.8.6-bin.tar.gz
tar xzf apache-maven-3.8.6-bin.tar.gz

vi .bashrc
export M2_HOME=/apache-maven-3.8.6
export PATH=$M2_HOME/bin:$PATH

source .bashrc
mvn -version

Difference B/w plugin and dependencies
Plugins are software components that extend the functionality of another software application. 
Dependencies are external libraries or modules used to build and run a software project

step to build project

by using git clone "url" clone respository to your server
move to the project directory

if their is pom.xml file use this command :

mvn compile "compile code"
mvn test "to test"
mvn Package " package"
mvn install "to install"

if you build success then your project is succesfully build
